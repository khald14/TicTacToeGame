### `Game description`
In this project I implemented Client Server architecture, where there are two clients connected to server which transfer the data between the two clients, Like the Positions of the moves, names and colors of clients' symbols.

I built a normal tic tac toe game that two clients can play against each other, each player can pick his name, his symbol color and start to play immediately,    If there are one  player who registered The server make him wait until another player connect to the server.
